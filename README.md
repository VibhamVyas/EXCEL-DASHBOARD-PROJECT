# EXCEL-DASHBOARD-PROJECT

HELLO READER/VIEWER/HIRING MANAGER

The "Workspace Essentials Sales & Profit Analysis Dashboard" microsoft excel project
involved cleaning and preparing the dataset by removing blanks, nulls, unwanted columns,
duplicates, and correcting data types. The main measures used for analysis were sales,
quantity, discount, and profit.

The project included the development of a dynamic dashboard with calculated fields,
layouting, and custom charts and maps. The charts and maps used for visualization included
a combo chart displaying sales and profit by months, a waterfall chart showing profit by
category, a pie chart illustrating sales by category, and a clustered bar chart presenting sales
by the top 5 subcategories.

Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales, profit, quantity, order count, and profit
margin were calculated and represented using line charts and percentages for year-on-year
growth analysis. Additionally, a field map was created to showcase the top 50 countries with
sales totals.

The project also involved formatting the dashboard to enhance visual appeal and facilitate
data interpretation. Slicers were incorporated to enable easy filtering of data by year,
segment, ship mode, and order priority.

The ultimate goal was to provide insights into sales and profit trends, monitor key metrics,
and identify opportunities for improvement. The dynamic nature of the dashboard allowed it
to adapt to newly added data, ensuring up-to-date analysis.

Overall, the "Workspace Essentials Sales & Profit Analysis Dashboard" project utilized data
from Kaggle to create an interactive and informative tool for analyzing sales and profit in the
context of various dimensions and metrics.
